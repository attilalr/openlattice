openlattice
===========

Openlattice is a tool for visualization data in [x,y,color] format from stdin.
It is written in pygtk and the aimed features are a pausing capability and a 
saving tool for the images.

It must be modified for run without gazpacho. For now the gazpacho deb included
must be installed. To test the software you can use the data-ol.py program, it spits
x y color (0,1 or 2 for color).

python ./data-ol.py | ./openlattice

Press "comecar"

***************

Instalation

A very simple script to install (ubuntu tested) is included, run with:

sudo ./install-debian-ubuntu.sh
